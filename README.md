# CRM Project - Django + DRF

## üìå Overview
A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system built using **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  
It supports core CRM functionalities such as **Lead Management**, **Contact Management**, **Tickets**, **Campaigns**, **Notes**, and **Attachments**, along with **secure JWT-based authentication**.

This project includes advanced features like asynchronous task processing with **Celery + Redis**, caching with Redis for API optimization, real-time notifications via **Django Channels (WebSockets)**, API tracking/logging, and robust **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**.
